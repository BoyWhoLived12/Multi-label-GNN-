Graph Neural Network(GNN) recently has received a lot of attention due to its ability to analyze graph structural data. This article gives a gentle introduction to Graph Neural Network. It covers some graph theories for the ease to understand graphs and the problems in analyzing graphs. It then introduces Graph Neural Network in different forms and their principles. It also covers what GNN can do and some applications of GNN.
